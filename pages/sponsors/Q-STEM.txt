We would like to express our sincere gratitude to our sponsor, Q-Mark STEM, for supporting us financially, providing the funds for the development class competition.

 Q-Mark STEM aims to standardize the evaluation of STEM products and provide higher product quality assurance for STEM product developers to help the industry and consumers identify or judge the performance and quality of STEM products. 
Since the 2015 Policy Address, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government has been promoting STEM education to cultivate students' interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The objective is to nurture their creativity, collaboration, and problem-solving skills to meet the demands of future innovation and a pioneering spirit. However, many STEM educators feel that their knowledge and experience in STEM are either general or insufficient, and they express a desire for more training and support, both in terms of hardware and software. Q-Mark STEM provides product/service evaluation to these educators and provides quality assurance to STEM products.
