We would like to express our sincere gratitude to our sponsor, Golden Resources, for supporting us financially - providing the funds for the development class competition.

Golden resources was founded in 1946 as a trading company named Yuen Loong, which obtained its rice importing license in Hong Kong in 1955 and began the Groupâ€™s romance with rice for decades. With the wholesaling license Yuen Long acquired in 1959, it opened the door for a vertically integrated range of business activities including rice import, wholesale, warehousing and distribution. Golden Resources is also the proud owner of the popular convenience store brand, Circle K, in Vietnam as the group has acquired the master licensing rights from Circle K Stores Inc. in 2008.
