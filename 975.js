The objective is to nurture their creativity, collaboration, and problem-solving skills to meet the demands of future innovation and a pioneering spirit. However, many STEM educators feel that their knowledge and experience in STEM are either general or insufficient, and they express a desire for more training and support, both in terms of hardware and software. Q-Mark STEM provides product/service evaluation to these educators and provides quality assurance to STEM products."}}]);
