With the wholesaling license Yuen Long acquired in 1959, it opened the door for a vertically integrated range of business activities including rice import, wholesale, warehousing and distribution. Golden Resources is also the proud owner of the popular convenience store brand, Circle K, in Vietnam as the group has acquired the master licensing rights from Circle K Stores Inc. in 2008.\n"}}]);
